# Backend and Security Features:

- Flask Backend: The application's backend is powered by Flask, a lightweight and efficient web framework suitable for handling dynamic data requests and serving real-time information.
- Security: To enhance security and user convenience, the website employs a password-less sign-in mechanism. Users sign in using their email address, and a verification link is sent to their inbox. Clicking this link grants them access to the site, thereby ensuring both security and ease of use.

# Technical and Aesthetic Design:
The design of the website prioritizes aesthetics and functionality, ensuring that information is both accessible and visually appealing. The interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing travelers to quickly find the information they need while providing a pleasant browsing experience.

This airport information software not only streamlines the process of traveling by providing all necessary services under one digital roof but also ensures that the user experience is secure and efficient through thoughtful backend architecture and innovative security measures.
